# [](#puppeteer-playwright-course) Puppeteer/Playwright course

<!-- Talk a bit about puppeteer and playwright -->
<!-- talk about headless browsers -->
<!-- ADD HEADLESS BROWSERS TO CONCEPTS -->
<!-- talk about what they're useful for in contrast to raw HTTP requests -->
<!-- Talk about dynamic pages -->
<!-- ADD DYNAMIC PAGES TO CONCEPTS? -->

<!-- They're both extremely similar libraries, which is why we're combining their courses into one -->
<!-- explain why they're so similar (same team made them both) -->
<!-- There will be examples for both libraries, but we recommend using the newer Playwright as it has more features and better documentation -->

## [](#course-overview) Course overview

<!-- Everything that will be learned in the course -->

<!-- Will be scraping fake-webstore -->
<!-- 1. opening a page (talk about what is browsercontext, what is a page, what is headless vs headful - it's headless by default) -->
<!-- 2. interacting with a page (talk about page.evaluate, page.click, page.type, etc.) -->
<!-- 3. collecting data from a page (using page.evaluate, or also using cheerio (better option) - but with cheerio it's running in a different context) -->
<!-- 4. Modifying headers, geolocation, adding proxies, etc. -->

<!-- Don't forget: In each lesson, have marked tabs examples for both puppeteer and playwright -->
